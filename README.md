# Machine vision based similarity modeling of rock fractures in tunnel face
## Graduate Thesis
1. Proposed a visualization method of discrete fracture network with randomly generated fracture trace maps based on machine vision methods and statistical principles using Python language, and thus established a complete discrete fracture network similarity evaluation system.
2. Proposed a pointing plus gridding algorithm to accurately calculate the position and density similarity of trace maps, innovatively took spacing similarity index into the calculation of comprehensive similarity
3. Applied the established system to the actual project to test its reliability and applicability
